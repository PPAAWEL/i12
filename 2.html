It echos in my head, words that can't repair,<br>
It's up to you, now<br>
To make it up to see, nothing to discuss<br>
We're going down, down, down<br>
You say you never heard it before,<br>
You call me liar, leave in anger, slamming the door<br>
You never tried to meet my fear cause,<br>
You keep your exit and now I know<br>
We could be the reason why we can go on<br>
U and me, we have to learn to get along<br>
Disbelief, it will slowly break us down<br>
For good, it would<br>
Solo violin<br>
We fight we make it up, as we go along<br>
That's what I'm used to<br>
It works if I obey, roles I have to play,<br>
To get a long, long, long<br>
You say you never heard it before,<br>
You call me liar, leave in anger, slamming the door<br>
You never tried to meet my fear cause,<br>
You keep your exit and now I know<br>
We could be the reason why we can go on<br>
You and me, we have to learn to get along<br>
Disbelief it will slowly break us down<br>
For good, it would<br>
Solo violin<br>
We could be the reason why we can go on<br>
You and me, we have to learn to get along<br>
Disbelief, it will slowly break us down<br>
For good<br>
