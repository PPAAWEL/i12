When loneliness, is knocking on your door<br>
Everything you loved, just disappears<br>
And when you feel, that everything is lost<br>
You need to know, there's no life without tears<br>
Oh, oh oh oh tell me black or white<br>
What color is your life<br>
Oh, oh oh oh try to ask your heart<br>
Who you really are<br>
No one is, forever beautiful and young<br>
Everything you know, just disappears<br>
Fame and gold are nothing, you can be sure<br>
When there is no love in your heart<br>
The choice is yours, who you really want to be<br>
Don't be afraid , of your destiny<br>
So when you feel, that everything is lost<br>
You need to know, there's no life without fear<br>
Oh, oh oh oh tell me black or white<br>
What color is your life<br>
Oh, oh oh oh try to ask your heart<br>
Who you really are<br>
Every day, we must fight with the wind<br>
We have to live<br>
All these things are just empty desire<br>
'Couse ther's no smoke without fire<br>
Oh, oh oh oh tell me black or white<br>
What color is your life<br>
Oh, oh oh oh try to ask your heart<br>
Who you really are<br>
Oh, oh oh oh try to ask your heart<br>
What color is your life<br>
