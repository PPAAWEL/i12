I fell by the wayside like everyone else<br>
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself<br>
Our every moment, I start to replace<br>
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say<br>
When you hurt under the surface<br>
Like troubled water running cold<br>
Well, time can heal, but this won't<br>
So, before you go<br>
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?<br>
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather<br>
So, before you go<br>
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?<br>
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless<br>
So, before you go<br>
Was never the right time, whenever you called<br>
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all<br>
Our every moment, I start to replay<br>
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face<br>
When you hurt under the surface<br>
Like troubled water running cold<br>
Well, some can heal, but this won't<br>
So, before you go<br>
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?<br>
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather<br>
So, before you go<br>
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?<br>
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless<br>
So, before you go<br>
Would we be better off by now<br>
If I'd have let my walls come down?<br>
Maybe, I guess we'll never know<br>
You know, you know<br>
Before you go<br>
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?<br>
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather<br>
So, before you go<br>
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?<br>
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless<br>
So, before you go<br>
