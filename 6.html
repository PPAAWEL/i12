Walk in your rainbow paradise (paradise)<br>
Strawberry lipstick state of mind (state of mind)<br>
I get so lost inside your eyes<br>
Would you believe it?<br>
You don't have to say you love me<br>
You don't have to say nothing<br>
You don't have to say you're mine<br>
Honey<br>
I'd walk through fire for you<br>
Just let me adore you<br>
Oh, honey<br>
I'd walk through fire for you<br>
Just let me adore you<br>
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do<br>
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do<br>
Your wonder under summer skies (summer skies)<br>
Brown skin and lemon over ice<br>
Would you believe it?<br>
You don't have to say you love me<br>
I just wanna tell you something<br>
Lately you've been on my mind<br>
Honey<br>
I'd walk through fire for you<br>
Just let me adore you<br>
Oh, honey<br>
I'd walk through fire for you<br>
Just let me adore you<br>
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do<br>
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do<br>
I'd walk through fire for you<br>
Just let me adore you<br>
Oh, honey<br>
I'd walk through fire for you<br>
Just let me adore you<br>
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do<br>
I'd walk through fire for you<br>
Just let me adore you<br>
Oh, honey<br>
Oh, honey<br>
I'd walk through fire for you<br>
Just let me adore you<br>
Oh, honey<br>
Just let me adore you<br>
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do<br>
