I often tell myself that we could be more than just friends<br>
I know you think that if we move too soon it would all end<br>
I live in misery when you're not around<br>
I won't be satisfied till we're taking those vows<br>
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend<br>
Don't you wanna be more than friends?<br>
Hold me tight and don't let go<br>
Hold me tight and don't let go<br>
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend<br>
Don't you wanna be more than friends?<br>
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend<br>
Don't you wanna be more than friends?<br>
Hold me tight and don't let go<br>
Hold me tight and don't let go<br>
Hold me tight and don't let go<br>
Hold me tight and don't let go<br>
Hold me tight and don't let go<br>
I often fantasize the stars above are watching you<br>
They know my heart, it speaks to yours like only lovers do<br>
If I could wear your clothes I'd pretend I was you<br>
And lose control<br>
There'll be some love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin' love<br>
Love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin'<br>
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend<br>
Don't you wanna be more than friends?<br>
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend<br>
Don't you wanna be more than friends?<br>
(Hold me tight and don't let go)<br>
Runnin' in and outta life<br>
Has got me so confused<br>
We gotta make the sacrifice<br>
Somebody's gotta choose<br>
We can make it if we try<br>
For the sake of you and I<br>
Together we can make it right<br>
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend<br>
Don't you wanna be more than friends?<br>
Hold me tight and don't let go<br>
Hold me tight and don't let go<br>
Hold me tight and don't let go<br>
What's it gonna be?<br>
